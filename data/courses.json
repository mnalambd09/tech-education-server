        "details": "A computer engineer, equipped with a broad background in electrical engineering and computer science, will be entering an exciting and rapidly growing profession with unlimited opportunities in industry, government, and education. Many of our students have already participated in that world through internships. Some examples of internship placements are: Engineering Intern, AT&T Computer; Engineering Intern, IBM Corporation; Computer Engineering Intern, Computer Science Corporation; Computer Science Engineer Intern, Intel Corporation; and Engineering Technician, Mitre Corporation. Computer Engineering graduates are equipped for careers as engineers, electrical designers, electrical engineers, design and applications engineers, test engineers, power systems engineers, and product engineers."

        "details": "Civil engineers design, create and connect up the world around us. They help make our villages, towns and cities work for the people that live there. Have a look at all our civil engineering projects and see for yourself the work that civil engineers do. Includes our ICE 200 projects. It's about roads and railways, schools, offices, hospitals, water and power supply and much more. The kinds of things we take for granted but would find life very hard to live without. Civil engineer' covers a huge range of jobs and all types of engineering. Civil engineers come from all different backgrounds but they all spend years training, learning and getting qualifications. Why not hear what civil engineers have to say about their work?"
